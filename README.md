A practical collection of hands-on projects, real-world labs, and live demos focused on Huawei Cloud compute services. The goal is to help cloud engineers, developers, and learners understand how virtual machines, auto scaling, container engines, and cloud-native architecture come together in Huawei’s ecosystem. The work here maps to real workflows you’ll encounter in production, with clear steps, sane defaults, and repeatable exercises.

Topics covered include automation, autoscaling, CI/CD, cloud, Cloudflare integration, compute services, ECS service patterns, Huawei devices, Huawei Cloud, OpenStack underpinnings, serverless patterns, and Terraform. This repo gives you guided paths to build practical skills you can apply in your own Huawei Cloud deployments.

Lab guides and demos
Overview
Each lab guide provides a focused objective, prerequisites, step-by-step instructions, expected outcomes, and tips. Labs assume you have access to Huawei Cloud resources, and they are designed to work with a generic Huawei Cloud CLI or console credentials. Where possible, the guides include alternative steps if a specific service or API is not available in your region.
